# Arduino Example

Follow the [SparkFun hookup guide to setup the Pro Micro](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro--fio-v3-hookup-guide/all)

Install the [Adafruit SSD1306 library](https://learn.adafruit.com/monochrome-oled-breakouts/arduino-library-and-examples#arduino-library-and-examples).

I wanted to create a Fritzing diagram, but some of these parts are not in there, so is a picture that hopefully helps. Combined with the pinout from the hookup guide, pin numbering in the code, and labels on the boards hopefully you can figure it out.
