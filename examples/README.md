# Arduino Example

Follow the [SparkFun hookup guide to setup the Pro Micro](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro--fio-v3-hookup-guide/all)

Install the [Adafruit SSD1306 library](https://learn.adafruit.com/monochrome-oled-breakouts/arduino-library-and-examples#arduino-library-and-examples).

I wanted to create a Fritzing diagram, but some of these parts are not in there, so here are some shitty pictures. Combined with the pinout from the hookup guide, pin numbering in the code, and labels on the boards hopefully you can figure it out.
