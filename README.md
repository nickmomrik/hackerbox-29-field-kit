# Demos using HackerBox #0029: Field Kit

Install the [Adafruit SSD1306 & GFX libraries](https://learn.adafruit.com/monochrome-oled-breakouts/arduino-library-and-examples#arduino-library-and-examples).

Wiring the button module is a little tricky. The GND pin should actually go to VCC and each K(1-4) pin needs a pulldown resistor (10k works well).

Also check out [my unboxing and info post](https://nick.blog/2018/04/06/hackerbox-0029-field-kit/) about this box.
